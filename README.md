# File Explorer Organizer

## Welcome to the File Explorer Organizer!
### Do you ever feel like your files are getting way too unorganized? Look no further, this script has got your back!

### What It Does
This script is designed to read the file type of files within a specified directory and make folders accordingly.

### For Example:
Let's take the Downloads folder:

- Each time you download something off the internet, it goes straight to your "Downloads" folder.

- Without proper organization, the build-up of files can get intense in this area.

- Running this script will scan the directory and organize each file based on its type.

### How It Works
- Document Files: PDF, Word, TXT files will go to a Documents folder.

- Image Files: PNG, JPEG files will go to an Images folder.

- Script Files: SH, PY, JS files will go to a Scripts folder.

- And so on...

### Benefits
This makes for a cleaner look when trying to find a specific file within your system, or if you're just tired of looking at a messy directory.
